# Winter Trivia Bot
*I couldn't think of a better name...*

---

## Information

This is just a small little Trivia Bot made by TwilightZebby for use on Dr1fterX's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2d8ZVzs). (He's a [twitch streamer](https://twitch.tv/Dr1fterX))

Every December, he sets up about 7 Winter Houses (Roles) that we can self-assign for a little fun. I thought that this year (2020) we could have an inter-House competition. This is where this Discord Bot comes in!

The Bot's Trivia Rounds works as so:

* Once a round starts (triggered using a command by that round's host), a series of random winter/christmas themed trivia questions are given to the Users in a special Text Channel.
* Each question is given one at a time, with about a minute given to try and answer it correctly.
* Users earn points for answering questions correctly.
* *However,* only the first ten (10) to answer correctly gets points. The quicker you are of those 10, the more points you earn!

Additionally, the Bot will also know which Winter House/Role that User is in, and keep a running total of *all* the points that House has - meaning that there are two leaderboards! Once for the Top 10 Users, and another for the Houses.

**Why are the questions and answers hidden?**
> Because I made this Repo public during our Trivia Rounds, so `questions.json` was kept hidden via `.gitignore` as to prevent peeps from cheating ;P
>
> Also, it is staying hidden just in case we decide to use this Bot again for other seasonal Trivia Rounds on the Discord Server.
